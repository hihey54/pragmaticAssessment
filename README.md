# Description

This repository is organized as follows:

* _pragmatic_assessment_: this is the folder containing the source-code of our experiments (data-acquisition, preprocessing, evaluation);
* _user_study_: this folder contains some additional data pertaining to our user_study;
* _camera_ready.pdf_: this document corresponds to the final version of our paper, which will appear in the proceedings of the conference;
* _supplementary.pdf_: this document is an "extension" of our paper, providing additional experimental details and the full results of our pragmatic assessment (it was omitted from the camera ready due to page constraints);
* _full_paper.pdf_: this document combines the two previous ones, and was the version of the paper "accepted" during the peer-review process of IEEE EuroSP'23.
